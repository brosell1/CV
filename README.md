## About me
Iâ€™m a trainee full stack Javascript developer and a member of the first cohort of the School Of Code bootcamp. The learning curve has been very steep and I have enjoyed encountering new concepts every week. I began learning React and Redux about half way through the bootcamp and I took to it very quickly, working on a variety of React projects to improve my skills. My skillset is very diverse, with experience working in industries ranging from hospitality to social media and digital marketing.
